# The review
> This section outlines how to construct an effective review process for candidate assessments. This process should be collaboratively developed with your team and kept confidential from candidates.

## Introduction

This guide is intended to standardise the review process of candidates' submissions. It ensures fairness, objectivity, and consistency in evaluating the technical skills of each candidate. 

## Reviewer Responsibilities

- Approach each review impartially and without bias.
- Evaluate based on the criteria outlined, not on personal preferences.
- Provide constructive feedback that is helpful to the candidate.

## Evaluation Criteria

### Pre-evaluation

Conduct a preliminary check to ascertain if the submission is complete and meets basic requirements.

- **Completeness**: Verify if all required components of the task are submitted.
- **Initial Compliance**: Check if the submission adheres to basic requirements such as format, submission method, and deadline adherence.
- **Proceed or Halt**: If the submission is incomplete or fails to meet basic requirements, halt further review and provide feedback on these preliminary aspects.

### Documentation
Evaluate the clarity, completeness, and relevance of the candidate's documentation.

- **Clarity**:  Is the documentation easy to understand?
- **Completeness**: Does it effectively explain the solution and thought process?
- **Relevance**: Is the information provided pertinent and helpful?

### Source Control Usage
Assess the candidate's proficiency in using source control systems:

- **Organization**: Is the repository well-organized and navigable?
- **Commit History**: Do the commits have clear messages and reflect a logical development process?

### Code Quality
Determine the overall quality of the candidateâ€™s code by evaluating:

 - **Reusability**: Is the code modular and adaptable?
 - **Durability**: Can the code handle unexpected inputs and situations? Does it include error handling?
 - **Structure and Clarity**: Is the solution's architecture logical? Are code and components well-organized?
 - **Security**: Are there safeguards against vulnerabilities? Is user data handled securely?
 - **Observability**:  Is the code easily monitored and debugged? Are logs and metrics effectively used?

### Testing
Review the testing approach for effectiveness, quality, and reliability.

- **Effectiveness/Coverage**: Are tests comprehensive, covering various cases?
- **Quality**: Is the testing approach well-conceived and executed?
- **Reliability**: Do the tests accurately validate the functionality?

## Scoring System

The scoring system for evaluating candidates should reflect the priorities and values of your team and company. Use a scale of 1-5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest, to score each criterion based on its importance to the role.

- **Weighting of Criteria**: Assign different weightings to each criterion according to its relevance. For instance, if source control is less critical for your team, you might assign a maximum of 1 point to it. Conversely, for highly valued criteria like code quality, use the full 1-5 scale to differentiate more effectively between submissions.
- **Scoring Sub-Criteria**: Within each main criterion, assign scales to sub-criteria based on their importance. For example, if reusability under Code Quality is less crucial, you might score it on a 1-2 scale, while assigning a 1-5 scale to more critical sub-criteria like security or observability.
- **Guidance for Assigning Scores**: Provide clear guidelines on what to look for in each criterion and its sub-criteria. For example:
  - **For Code Quality** - Reusability, a score of 1 might indicate minimal or no modular coding, while a score of 5 reflects highly modular and reusable code.
  - **In Source Control Usage**, frequent, well-documented commits might warrant a higher score, whereas sparse, unclear commit history could result in a lower score.
- **Justification for Scores**: Reviewers should justify each score with specific examples from the candidate's submission. This justification ensures transparency and provides valuable feedback to the candidate.
- **Balancing the System**: Ensure the overall scoring system is balanced and aligns with the role requirements. Avoid overemphasizing less critical aspects at the expense of key skills and competencies.

> **Notes**:
> - **Flexibility**: Adjust the scoring scale based on the specific requirements and values of your team and organization.
> - **Reviewer Calibration**: Ensure all reviewers understand and apply the scoring system consistently.
> - **Constructive Feedback**: Use the scoring system as a tool for providing detailed and constructive feedback, helping candidates understand their evaluation.
