## Application Review

So, you have a CV in hand - what's next? Before delving into the candidate's experience, it’s essential to identify the attributes you’re looking for. Regardless of the role, there are several key personal qualities that I consider non-negotiable for any candidate:

- Effective Communication
- Teamwork Ability
- Sense of Responsibility

Why are these traits vital? Imagine having a team member who struggles with communication, can't collaborate effectively, or shirks responsibility. That's a scenario you'd want to avoid. When reviewing CVs, try to discern indications of these attributes.


### Effective communication

Look for signs of communication skills in their CV. Is it well-organized and clear? A well-prepared CV that effectively conveys the candidate's background and skills can be an initial sign of good communication. Evaluate their listed experiences for roles involving project coordination, team leadership, or similar responsibilities. Don't overlook activities like blogging, giving presentations, or mentoring roles.

### Teamwork Ability

References to working closely with others, participating in team meetings, or contributing to team-oriented goals suggest an ability for teamwork. Participation in group projects, especially in a leadership role, can indicate a strong teamwork skills.

### Sense of Responsibility

Identifying a sense of responsibility in a candidate's CV can be challenging, as this trait is often more subtle than others. Look for mentions of managing, owning, or leading specific processes or projects. Contributions to open-source projects or personal code repositories demonstrate initiative and a commitment to taking responsibility.

### Technical skills

While soft skills are vital, technical expertise is crucial, especially for mid to senior-level candidates. Define a clear list of technical skills required for the role, categorizing them as '`Must-Have`', '`Required`', and '`Nice-to-Have`'.

'`Must-Haves`' are essential, '`Required`' skills can be scored on a scale, and '`Nice-to-Haves`' offer bonus points. Here's an example for a mid-level Python backend developer role:


```
## Must-Have Skills
- Proficiency in Python: Solid understanding and experience.
- Version Control: Proficiency with tools like Git.
- Basic SQL Knowledge: Experience with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL.
- Open Source Library Work: Experience with frameworks or known libraries.

## Required Skills
- API Development (1-5 points): Experience in developing RESTful APIs.
- Unit Testing (1-3 points): Knowledge in creating and maintaining tests.
- Basic Front-end Technologies Understanding (1-3 points).
- Code Optimization (1-3 points): Ability to identify and fix efficiency issues.

## Nice-to-Have Skills
- Microservices Architecture: Understanding or experience.
- Cloud Services: Experience with platforms like AWS Lambda.
- CI/CD: Familiarity with continuous deployment processes.
```
Remember, the specifics of these lists can vary depending on the particular needs and focus of your company or project.


## Preliminary Screening

The preliminary screening phase is a pivotal step in evaluating candidates' soft skills and alignment with your company's culture. This initial assessment, typically managed by HR or external recruiters, focuses on gauging cultural fit and personal attributes such as communication skills.

It's crucial to collaborate closely with the HR team during this stage. Gaining insights into the candidates' responses and the questions posed by HR enriches your understanding and preparation for subsequent interviews or technical assessments. Being well-prepared not only demonstrates respect for the candidate's time but also ensures a more meaningful and efficient dialogue, avoiding redundant questions.

This thorough preparation significantly enhances the candidate's impression of your company and the recruitment process. It reflects an organized and considerate approach, leaving a positive impact on their experience.

> In scenarios involving external recruiters, actively participating in structuring initial interview questions is beneficial. This involvement ensures that the questions are tailored to assess soft skills effectively, giving you confidence in the candidates' potential compatibility with your team, whether for enhancing an existing team or building a new one.

## Technical Assessment

This stage is where your expertise as a developer comes into play, whether you're leading the technical assessment or participating as a team member.  The objective is to determine the candidate’s technical suitability and their fit with the team, a task that often presents considerable challenges.

For assessing more senior or advanced developers, consider an on-call technical evaluation or a practical task with a set timeframe. Begin by reviewing any public Git repositories to understand their coding style and proficiency. This preliminary evaluation provides a base for assessing their technical capabilities.

In cases where public repositories are not available, or for a more structured approach, assign a practical task relevant to the role. For instance, backend developers might be tasked with developing an API endpoint, while front-end developers could be asked to create a component interfacing with an API. These tasks, though simple for experienced developers, are effective in evaluating technical and problem-solving abilities. Use the same task for different experience levels, but adjust the scoring criteria to match the expectations for each role.

A comprehensive review guide is essential for a consistent and fair evaluation. This guide should outline the task, evaluation criteria, and scoring system. Involving your team in the review process not only aids in their development but also ensures a more inclusive approach to recruitment. For reference, an example review guide template is available for download from my [Git repository](https://github.com/dkraczkowski/dkraczkowski.github.io/blob/main/articles/building-recruitment-process/review_guide.md).

The next section will delve into conducting interviews, both with and without a technical task assignment.

> **Confidentiality Note**: Maintaining the confidentiality of the assessment process, especially the scoring system and evaluation criteria, is crucial. If shared with your team, stress the importance of keeping this information secure to avoid potential manipulation of the system by candidates, thereby preserving the integrity and fairness of your assessments.

### Interview with a technical task assignment

When a candidate successfully passes the technical task and progresses to the next stage, the focus should be on a balanced evaluation. Start by reviewing their submission, identifying strengths and areas for improvement. This forms the basis for a constructive interview, where you can commend their accomplishments while addressing potential enhancements.

Begin the interview by acknowledging their successes in the task, then pivot to discuss areas that could be improved. This not only assesses their technical prowess but also their receptiveness to growth and adaptation. Discussions around these aspects offer insights into their problem-solving abilities and can indicate if adjustments are needed in the task's complexity or timeframe.

The essence of the interview lies in exploring the candidate's decision-making process and approach to challenges. Engage in a dialogue that tests their methods and introduces alternative scenarios. This conversation uncovers their technical skills, adaptability, and innovative thinking.

Addressing any mistakes in their submission is an opportunity to assess the candidate’s response to feedback and their problem-solving under pressure. Throughout, it’s important to maintain a supportive environment, considering the inherent stress of interviews.

**Effective time management** during an interview is important. Ensure there's room for candidates to pose their questions, reflecting their interests and concerns. Incorporate a segment on the candidate's personal interests and hobbies. This approach helps understand the candidate more holistically and can alleviate stress. If you sense the candidate is feeling pressured, smoothly shift the conversation to these lighter topics. This provides a break, often rejuvenating the candidate for more technical discussions later.


> Remember, the **authenticity** of your engagement is vital. **Genuine interest** in the candidate's responses is key; superficial or insincere questions can negatively impact their perception of the interview. Ensure your inquiries into their personal interests are both authentic and respectful, demonstrating a true desire to understand them as individuals.

### Interview without a technical task assignment

Conducting interviews without a pre-assigned technical task requires a nuanced approach, blending technical probing with personal engagement. Such interviews demand in-depth insight and preparation.

If you’re uncertain about your interviewing skills, prepare with a set of open questions that alternate between evaluating technical skills and delving into the candidate's hobbies and interests. This balance explores both their professional expertise and personal inclinations.

A collaborative technique I frequently use involves working on a diagram or process with the candidate, like outlining the steps for `uploading and staging a file`. This interactive method assesses their technical understanding, collaborative problem-solving ability, and communication skills. Encourage them to sketch diagrams or write pseudocode while explaining their thought process, offering insights into both their technical acumen and clarity in communication.

Periodically challenge their ideas to test problem-solving skills and responsiveness to feedback, essential traits in any professional environment. Ask about their past experiences, focusing on challenges they've faced, achievements, and the reasoning behind their pride. These inquiries can reveal much about their work ethic and passion.

Involving a team member in the interview adds a different perspective to the assessment. Ask how the candidate stays current with industry trends and technologies, and inquire about recent tech developments that have caught their interest. This reveals their engagement with the broader industry.

In both scenarios, whether the interview includes a technical task or not, the importance of the human element cannot be overstated. As mentioned earlier, authenticity in your interactions is key to a successful exchange. However, it's also important to adapt your approach based on the interview format.

In interviews without a technical task, where direct assessment of skills through a practical demonstration isn't possible, paying close attention to the candidate's responses becomes even more crucial. Your genuine interest in their answers helps in creating a connection that can lead to more insightful revelations about their capabilities and personality.

### Wrapping up the interview

As you conclude the interview, it's crucial to provide the candidate with clear information about the next steps. This clarity not only manages their expectations but also reflects the professionalism and organization of your company.

Equally important is the collection of feedback from the candidates about their experience. Their insights are invaluable for refining and enhancing the interview process. Remember, interviews are not solely about gauging a candidate’s fit for a specific role; they're about understanding who they are as individuals. This requires a careful balance of skill evaluation, personality assessment, and an estimation of their potential integration into your team.

Throughout this process, empathy, adaptability, and a deep understanding of human nature are key. Each candidate brings a unique set of experiences and perspectives, making it essential for interviewers to be flexible and empathetic. The interview is a complex interaction that goes beyond mere skill assessment — it’s about building a connection and understanding the candidate in a comprehensive manner.

## Post interview steps

The conclusion of the interview initiates a vital phase in the recruitment process - the post-interview evaluation and decision-making. This stage is crucial for effectively utilising the insights gained during the interview to make a well-informed hiring decision.

1. **Organise a Review Meeting**: Arrange a meeting with all team members involved in the interview. This session is essential to bring together different viewpoints and form a comprehensive evaluation of the candidate’s performance.
2. **Collect Team Feedback**: Encourage each participant to share their observations and opinions, discussing the candidate's technical skills, problem-solving abilities, cultural fit, and overall impression. Valuing each team member’s input is key to a holistic evaluation.
3. **Document the Feedback**: Systematically compile the feedback, ensuring it includes specific examples and observations that substantiate the team's assessment. The detail and organization of this documentation are critical for informed decision-making.
4. **Communicate with HR or Senior Management**: Once the team’s feedback is compiled and reviewed, the next step is to communicate this information to the HR department or recruiter. In the absence of an HR department, these insights should be shared directly with the CTO, CEO, or the relevant decision-making authority in the organisation.
5. **Provide a Holistic Overview**: When presenting the feedback, ensure it encompasses both the strengths and areas for improvement observed in the candidate. A balanced overview will aid in making a decision that aligns with both the technical requirements and the cultural dynamics of the team.
6. **Recommendation for Next Steps**: Based on the collective feedback, make a recommendation on whether to proceed with the candidate. This could involve a second interview, a job offer, or deciding not to move forward. The recommendation should be aligned with the consensus of the team and the documented observations.

## Last notes
Involving a teammate in the interview process is not just beneficial for their growth as a developer and their interviewing skills; it also serves as a support system for you as an interviewer. Drawing from my own experiences, I've encountered scenarios where seemingly simple questions about implementation details led to unexpected reactions from candidates, including rage quits and other unpleasant situations. Remember, people respond differently under stress, and having another person in the interview can be a safeguard, ensuring a safer and more controlled environment.

When bringing a teammate into the interview, it’s important to set the stage properly. Allocate time for everyone to introduce themselves, clarifying their roles in the process. Whether your teammate is there for training purposes or as an observer, making this clear to the candidate helps in setting a comfortable and transparent atmosphere. This practice not only fosters a sense of security but also promotes a more open and respectful dialogue during the interview.
