## How to run examples locally

In order to run examples locally you need to have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Ensure that poetry is set to create virtual environments in the project directory:

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

Then you can install all dependencies by running
```bash
poetry install
```
